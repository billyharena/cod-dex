        The Weeknd, born Abel Tesfaye on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Canada, is a renowned Canadian singer and songwriter. <br> 
        Known for his alternative R&B style, he gained fame with explicit songs touching on themes of sex and drugs. <br>
        The Weeknd's music is characterized by unconventional production techniques and atmospheric, trip-hop-infused R&B and synth-driven pop. <br>
        He transitioned from uploading songs anonymously on YouTube to becoming a global pop superstar, breaking records on platforms like Spotify. <br>
        With hits like "After Hours," he continues to captivate audiences with his dynamic sound and introspective lyrics.
